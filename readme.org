This tiny package fixes two features in upstream Helm:

- Add a =helm-switch-to-shell= action which generalizes
  =helm-ff-switch-to-shell= for any REPL (SLIME, SLY, IELM, or add your own).

- Add this feature to =helm-locate= and other file related Helms.

* Installation

Call =helm-switch-to-repl-setup=.

* Usage

Fire up =helm-find-files= or other =helm-type-file= sources such as
=helm-locate=, navigate to where you want, then call the =Switch to REPL= action
bound to =M-e= by default.
